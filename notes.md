I need commands for two types of reports. Both commands take a datetime argument.

- For the Year and Week containing the datetime specified: total of all timers for that week
    - for each day in that week (beginning with Monday): total of all timers for that day
        - each timer for the day ordered by account and datetime

- For the Year and Month containing the datetime specified: total of all timers for that month
    - for each account: total from all timers for that account for that year and month
        - each timer for that account for that year and month ordered by datetime
