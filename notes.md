# ToDo

- [ ] Add memo 


# Chat

1. Add a method "archive_timers" to set the status to "inactive" for all timers with "datetime" entries < 00:00 hours on the current date. It would be nice if this command could be executed automatically when any command is executed for the first time in a new day. 

2. In list_timers provide an option to include all timers, i.e., timers with any status in ('inactive', 'running', 'paused'), but make the default only to show timers with status in ('running', 'paused'). 

- Make the "start_date" optional in "report-account". When not given, do not prompt for end_date and create report for all months
